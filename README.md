Welcome to my comprehensive **Python repository**! This collection showcases my journey from mastering foundational Python concepts to implementing advanced machine learning projects. It's designed to serve as both a learning resource and a demonstration of my skills.

**Introduction**

This repository is structured to guide you through:

- **Core Python Programming**: Understanding variables, data types, control structures, functions, and object-oriented programming with hands-on coding.
  
- **Solved Interview Questions**: A curated set of Python interview questions with detailed explanations and solutions.**PS**

- **Advanced Machine Learning Projects**: Implementations of complex machine learning algorithms and projects. **ML**,**MLP**

**Explore foundational Python concepts**:

- **Data Types & Variables**: Integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.
  
- **Control Structures**: If-else statements, loops (for, while), and comprehensions.
  
- **Functions**: Defining functions, lambda expressions, and decorators.

**Solved Interview Questions**

- A collection of Python interview questions categorized by difficulty:

- Easy: Basic syntax, data types, and control structures.

- Intermediate: Functions, modules, and error handling.
