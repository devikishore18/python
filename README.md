Welcome to my comprehensive Python repository! This collection showcases my journey from mastering foundational Python concepts to implementing advanced machine learning projects. It's designed to serve as both a learning resource and a demonstration of my skills.

ðŸ”° Introduction
This repository is structured to guide you through:
Core Python Programming: Understanding variables, data types, control structures, functions, and object-oriented programming.
Solved Interview Questions: A curated set of Python interview questions with detailed explanations and solutions.
Advanced Machine Learning Projects: Implementations of complex machine learning algorithms and projects.

Explore foundational Python concepts:
Data Types & Variables: Integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.
Control Structures: If-else statements, loops (for, while), and comprehensions.
Functions: Defining functions, lambda expressions, and decorators.

Solved Interview Questions
A collection of Python interview questions categorized by difficulty:
Easy: Basic syntax, data types, and control structures.
Intermediate: Functions, modules, and error handling.
